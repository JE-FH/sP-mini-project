\section{Build guide}
The project uses cmake and vcpkg. Vcpkg must be installed and integrated, then the toolchain file from vcpkg needs be specified when the cmake build is initialized. The source can only be compiled MSVC 19.40. GCC lacks some c++23 features (\texttt{insert_range} on \texttt{std::set}) and clang cannot build plplot.

\section {Results}

When running the demo executable, all the figures from requirement 5 and 6 are generated and results are generated for requirement 7 and 8.
The graphs and human readable forms for the reaction networks are also generated to conform with requirement 3

Using multithreading, we achieve a $\frac{623.02525}{45.158101}\approx13.797$ times speed up. It should scale very well since each simulation can run completely independenly because there are no synchronization between threads. However, since the CPU has multithreading and different CPU core types as well as sharing many other resources, we dont see a complete linear speedup.
